### Colour Spaces  
##### BGR:   
Standard colour image. Same as RGB image.   
###### When not use:  
###### When not to use:  
In most cases you should not perform image processing with BGR/RGB images.  

##### HSV:  
Hue, Saturation and value. Hue = dominant color; the names that we give to colors (such as green, yellow, blue, and red) correspond to the different hue values. Saturation = how vivid the color is; pastel colors have low saturation, colors of the rainbow = highly saturated. Brightness/Value = luminosity of a color.

### Channel  
##### Short-Description:   
Colour images are composed of 3 channels. Each of these channels correspond to the intensity value of one of the three primary colors.   
##### Practical application example:   
A BGR image is said to have 3 channels: a blue channel, a green channel and a red channel. A gray-scale image has 1 channel.
